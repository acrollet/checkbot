    <h1>Checkbot</h1>

    <p>Checkbot is a tool to verify links on a set of HTML
    pages. Checkbot can check a single document, or a set of documents
    on one or more servers. Checkbot creates a report which summarizes
    all links which caused some kind of warning or error.</p>

    <h2>Getting Checkbot</h2>

    <p>Current releases of Checkbot can always be found on <a
    href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/">CPAN</a>, the Comprehensive Perl
    Archive Network. Currently the latest version is <a
    href="checkbot-1.69.tar.gz">checkbot-1.69.tar.gz</a>.</p>

    <h3>Changes in version 1.69</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Improved makefile and packaging</li>
      <li>Better default for --match argument</li>
      <li>Additional instance of using GET instead of HEAD added</li>
      <li>Bug fixes in printing of web server feedback</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Changes in version 1.68</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Add --allow-simple-hosts which doesn't check for unqualified hosts
      <li>Mention --style option in help and added example style file
      <li>Change --sleep implementation so that fractional seconds can be used
      <li>Fix a bug with handling &lt;base&gt; tags
      <li>Tighten checks for http and https schemes
      <li>Remove harmless warnings
    </ul>

    <h3>Dependencies</h3>

    <p>Checkbot requires the following additional software, all of
      which is also available at CPAN. Try running the 'cpan' command
      to install them in your perl installation.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>perl 5 (version 5.005 recommended)</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.linpro.no/lwp/">LWP 5.50</a> (the
	  libwww-perl 5 module)</li>
      <li>HTML::Parser 3.10</li>
      <li>URI 1.10</li>
      <li>Net::FTP 2.00 (available in the libnet package)</li>
      <li>Mail::Send 1.03 (optional, needed to use --mailto option,
          available in the MailTools package)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In general, it is recommended to always use the most recent version of
      these modules. For instance, LWP 5.49 fixed a bug in handling
      relative Location: headers which caused problems when using
      Checkbot on some sites.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>

    <p>I usually keep an <a href="checkbot.html">example of a Checkbot
    run</a> around.</p>

    <h2>Brief overview</h2>

    <p>Checkbot collects all links from URLs matching the <code>match
    string</code>, and accessible through the <code>start
    url</code>. It has two categories of links: internal links (to
    other URLs matching the <code>match string</code>), and external
    links. The external links are filed for later use, while all
    internal links are checked.</p>

    <p>After checking all internal links Checkbot will check all
    external links found on the pages. It will <em>always</em> use the
    <code>HEAD</code> method for this. Checkbot does <em>not</em>
    adhere to the robots standard (which involves examining
    <code>/robots.txt</code> from a site first). However, people have
    brought some good arguments to my attention, so I will eventually
    implement this into Checkbot as well.</p>

    <p>After a interval (which gets exponentially longer) Checkbot
    will write its current results to a file. This file contains some
    statistics, such as number of links processed. It also contains a
    list of pages (sorted by server, and per server by page name)
    which contains links which generated an HTTP error code, along
    with that code.</p>
