<h1>Checkbot</h1>

Checkbot is a tool to verify links on a set of html pages. Checkbot
can check a set of documents on a single server, or on a set of
servers (e.g. all servers within a domain). <p>

Checkbot creates a report which summarizes all links which caused some
kind of error or warning.

<h2>How does Checkbot work?</h2>

Checkbot collects all links from URL's matching the <b>match
string</b>, and accessible through the <b>start url</b>. It has two
categories of links: internal links (to other URL's matching the
<b>match string</b>), and external links. The external links are filed
for later use, while all internal links are checked.  <p>

After checking all internal links Checkbot will check all external
links found on the pages. It will <em>always</em> use the
<tt>HEAD</tt> method for this. Checkbot does <em>not</em> adhere to
the robots standard (which involves examining <tt>/robots.txt</tt>
from a site first). However, people have brought some good arguments
to my attention, so I will eventually implement this into Checkbot as
well. <p>

After a interval (which gets progressively longer) Checkbot will write
its current results to a file. This file contains some statistics,
such as number of links processed. It also contains a list of pages
(sorted by server, and per server by page name) which contains links
which generated an HTTP error code, along with that code.<p>

Look at a <a href="sample.html">small sample</a> from Checkbot 1.5 for
my <a href="http://is.twi.tudelft.nl/hci/">HCI Index</a>.

<h2>Availability</h2>

The current release of Checkbot can now be retrieved through the
page. However, note that I consider this to be an
<b><em>ALPHA</em></b> release. I just completed a move from
Perl4/libwww4 to Perl5/libwww5. This has made things quite a bit
cleaner, but I don't really trust the code too much yet. I'll keep
working on it, though. Also, I didn't really pay attention to
portability and configurability yet. <p>
