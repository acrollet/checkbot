	* checkbot:
	Added code to support regular expressions with the -m and -x
	arguments. Thanks to Thomas Thiel for the patch and suggestions.
	
	No strict checking on schemes, fixes problem with unknown schemes
	stopping checkbot. Thanks to Pierre-Yves Foucou.

	* checkbot: 
	Should create direcory for temporary files, and remove it
	afterwards. Noted by Steve Fisk.

	* checkbot: 
	Made a number of changes from or based on patches by Thomas Thiel:

	Added missing t option in Getopts string.

	Made -m argument optional. If not given, the -u argument is also
	used as the start argument.

	Temporary files are now created in a separate directory. Its name
	contains the PID of Checkbot, to allow several concurrent

	Checkbots being run. Also remove temporary files, unless
	debugging.

	Implement file:// scheme to allow direct checking (without HTTP
        server)

	* checkbot: 
	Fixed warnings (and in the process, a small bug as well).
	Added URL and proper name to help.

Sat Mar  2 11:51:45 1996  Hans de Graaff  <Hans.deGraaff@twi72.twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot: 
	Added 'require 5.002' (because libwww-perl5b8 requires it).
	Added 'use strict', and fixed problems resulting from this. This
	can be seen as a first step towards fixing the huge
	memory-consumption.
	Updated help.

Tue Feb 27 09:57:57 1996  Hans de Graaff  <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot:
	Fixed bug which occured when -x option was not present.
	Updated script to use libwww-perl5b8 function names. This is not
	backward compatible with versions prior to beta 8.

Mon Feb 26 12:46:08 1996  Hans de Graaff  <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot:
	Fixed bug with Referer header for external URL's.
	Also make server pages auto-refresh.

Sat Feb 24 11:48:15 1996  Hans de Graaff  <Hans.deGraaff@twi72.twi.tudelft.nl>

	* TODO: New file.

	* checkbot: Added single -x option as an additional exclude pattern.
	This overrules the -m match attribute.

Mon Dec 11 14:13:30 1995  Hans de Graaff  <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>

	* index.html
	Added libwww-perl5 address, and added a usage section.

	* checkbot.pl
	Removed this old perl4 version.

Fri Dec  8 13:41:43 1995  Hans de Graaff  <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot: 
	Major rewrite of most of the internal routines. The routines are
	much more structured now, and broken up into smaller routines.
	I also changed the way checked links are remembered. It should be
	much less efficient, CPU-wise, but more efficient memory-wise.

Fri Nov 24 16:45:18 1995  Hans de Graaff  <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot:
	Fixed small problems, mostly with output.
	Fixed checking of external links
	Changed sorting order

	* checkbot: 
	Perl5 version now works for the most part. Although Checkbot isn't
	fully finished I at least feel confident to release it.

Fri Aug 25 11:23:36 1995  Hans de Graaff  <graaff@is.twi.tudelft.nl>

	* Made a start with the perl5 version of checkbot. The modules in
	perl5 (e.g. LWP) look very promising, and should make checkbot
	quite a bit better.
