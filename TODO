*  Add provision for multiple -m match and -x exclude fields (or
   simply allow use of Perl regexps?)

*  Doing a HEAD on an ISMAP link causes a 500 server error. Maybe a 
   GET will be better for this.

*  Add a mechanism for entering authentication data in order to check
   such areas as well. Possibly allow multiple pairs. Rather not enter
   the passwords on the commandline.

*  Obey Robot rules. My current idea is to obey robot rules by default
   on all 'external' request, and ignore them on 'local'
   requests. Both of these should be changeable.

*  Checkbot consumes way too much memory. I must be leaking references
   to objects somewhere!
